# Knights-and-Knaves
AI for riddle solving and Logic. This is a program based on the implementation of logic and knowledge in the AI. 

## How does it work?
- A logic module is present in the directory which functions as the Logical reasoning module for the AI.
- The `puzzle.py` file contains the questions of the result and certain basic rules on how to solve the Knights and Knaves riddles.
- The AI then processes the questions and examines the rules. Using the `logic.py` module it draws conclusions and most of the time gives an accurate answer.

## Customization
You can customize this project! You make your own questions and write the rules for solving of the riddle. However do not change anything in `logic.py` as it can cause improper functioning of the AI. All the customization has to take place in the `puzzle.py` file. This project is open to all and anyone can access this project for free.

## Credits
`logic.py` module was made by cs50 and the basic implementation of the rules was done by `ManavMehta-Official`. You can contact us at:
